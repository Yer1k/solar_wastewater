## Project Overview
Shifting from fossil fuels energy sources to renewable energy sources in energy-intensive sectors, such as municipal wastewater treatment which regularly consumes more than 30% of the total energy used by a municipality, is important for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; GHG emissions reductions help mitigate climate change and may also save money and increase energy security for those municipalities that make renewable energy investments. While there is great potential for renewable energy adoption in the wastewater sector, data limitations constrain our understanding of both the scope and scale of renewable energy adoption at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and the energy (or environmental) justice implications of that adoption.
